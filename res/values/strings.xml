        This 1961 photo shows Dr. William H. Pickering, (center) JPL Director,
				presenting a Mariner spacecraft model to President John F. Kennedy,
				(right). NASA Administrator James Webb is standing directly behind
				the Mariner model. Mariner 2 launched fifty years ago on Aug. 27,
				1962. The Mariner 2 probe flew by Venus in 1962, sending back data
				on its atmosphere, mass, and weather patterns. It stopped
				transmitting in 1963 after delivering a wealth of scientific
				information. Image Credit: NASA
